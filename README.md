# Lunar Lander/370

A lunar lander implementation for MVS 3.8 or any other web server out there. All you need is a webserver and a browser... or an IBM mainframe with 1977-era MVS 3.8...   

The best Lunar Lander implementation is arguably the one for the DEC GT40 device (see here: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4lPE5Nytfc) .)  

However, given the excellent animation capabilities of Javascript, this game is an homage to the tradition of Lunar Landng gaming, especially for something as vintage as MVS 3.8.
